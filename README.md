## Version

0.1

note - it's not presently possible to have more than 1 helios object, and if you change the creation parameter (maximum total points), you must reload the patch. 

## Use

pd_helios currently builds on MacOS, tested on Mojave (OSX v10.14)

## To build

Clone this repo and the source code to pure data (see above)

```
cd pd_helios

make PDINCLUDEDIR=../pure-data/src/
```

(or wherever you cloned pure data)

To test the example patch:

```
pd help-helios.pd
```

(from wherever you have installed Pd. For the Purr-data distribution of Pd, I used this:)

```
/Applications/Pd-l2ork.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs help-helios.pd 
```
